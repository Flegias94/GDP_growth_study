first we see the biggest is luxemburg
second we see that the worst is burundi and then afghanistan then yemen
for the 3rd diagram we can see that even tho GDP for USA is massive on average GDP per capita in Europe is way ahead then the rest. and it looks like Africa is just flat-lining
only a selected -- under 10 countries have gdp per capita > than 20000 and we can see the distribution

from the scatterplot we can see that most countries are in the bracket of 0 - 20000 area of the plot. and we can see the big outliners
